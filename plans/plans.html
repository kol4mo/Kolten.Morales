        <p>
            While in College I plan on Focusing on a Degree in either Software and Game Development or Software Engineering. Constantly trying to excel in my classes, and making sure to build up my personal Portfolio. This would allow me to get a chance to go to hopefully any job.

            I Hope to get a job outside of the USA, likely a Scandanavian Country such as Norway. Thats due to political, economic, and other situations being a lot better in those countrys. Also the technology development Industry is comparable to that of the US. Other than that I try to keep my future unplanned, so that I can constantly be able adapt to my situation
