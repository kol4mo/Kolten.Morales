            While in college I'm getting a degree in Software and Game Development. I'm constantly trying to excel in my classes, and making sure to build this up, my personal portfolio. This is to hopefully work at a game company I like.

            I plan to get a job outside of the US, probably Sweden. Thats due to political, economic, and other situations being a lot better in those countries. Also the technology development Industry is comparable to that of the US.
