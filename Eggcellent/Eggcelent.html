        Sorry for the weird download, the zip file was too big for Github.(so download everything and in excellent_data, their is an .assets.zip file that need to be unzipped.) This game was made in unity with a club from highschool. you walk around exploring and collecting as many eggs as possible, a big hodge podge of memes.
