            Bio
        </h2>
        <p>
           I started off my obsession with computer science early in high school. I had entered the Coolmath Game Jam of 2019. Even though I didnt place at all, playing a video game that I made was spectacular in my eyes. I started taking more STEM courses, mostly engineering and computer science. Eventually I had to pick a college to go to, and good game development colleges are rare. Eventually I chose Neumont for its project based learning style, meaning it would easily build up my portfolio and resume and projects, like it is already doing now while I go to college.
